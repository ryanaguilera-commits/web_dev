        <h1>Why I love guitar</h1>
        <p><b>I love guitar because it calms me down when im stressed. Another reason I love guitar is because it reminds me of Calix, he plays a lot of instruments but he also plays guitar. Guitar is also very fun to play, I have this app called "Yousician" it has really helped me learn everr since i got my guitar.</b></p>
