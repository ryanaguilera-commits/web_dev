        <h1>Basketball is so amazing</h1>
        <h2>What is basketball?</h2>
        <p><b>Basketball is a game where you can not use your hands.<br> It is a 5v5 game meaning you have 5 players on your team going agaisnt 5 other players.<br> The goal of basketball is to get the ball in the hoop.</b></p>
        <h2>Why do I love basketball?</h2>
        <p>It is so fun. Basketball, if you can get other people to play with you, is honestly the most fun youll ever have.<br> Playing basketball with a group of competitive people just gives my mind a break, and I know it gives a lot of other people's mind a break too.<br>Another reason I love basketball is because there are so many different types of games you can play you don't always have to play a big game with 10 people.<br></p>
